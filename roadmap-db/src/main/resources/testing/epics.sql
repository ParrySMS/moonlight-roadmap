Infrastructure issues within the Cloud Platform will not affect productivity. # *Less environment-related bugs & surprises during releases:* Developers can debug upper environments, because they can run the deployed environments on their own machines. In the long-term, dockerizing the platform will directly prepare us for greater scalability and robustness.# *Ability to scale any service horizontally in the public cloud* #* **Implementing Docker means we can directly move to AWS, if needed. Otherwise, we can easily scale on-prem through Kubernetes or Docker Swarm if that''s the decision that''s made. # *Ability to update base image software (like Node):* #* **Previously, this required a entirely new infrastructure build-out which can take up to six months.

Given PM2 provides a more robust production environment, we should leverage PM2''s official/maintained docker image. Alpine is chosen as a base image due to greatly decreasing the docker image size. ** *NGINX:* *** *nginx:mainline-alpine-perl* *** *Why?:* NGINX has its own, official/maintained, image that we should leverage. Perl is chosen because it provides a means to pass down environment variables into nginx configurations, if desired. (This is not trivial, but possible with the perl module).

However, keeping it out of the picture so far has reduced some complexity (coordination with refresh times, one-off consistency issues, etc). If we鈥檙e seeing a traffic change, I think it鈥檇 be worth revisiting Varnish and adding it to the stack. This said, we鈥檇 need to do a few things to get this set up:A. Create a request to Core Services Team that includes:1.	Updated architecture with Varnish in the stack2.	Expected requests (which we should have from the awesome work you guys have already done in testing)3.	All other requirements here: https://mswiki.morningstar.com/display/CORE/Project+RequirementsB. Create an initial VCL and consider cache invalidation as part of the solution:1.	Propose a caching strategy that aligns with our data refresh for both autocomplete and id service. 2.	Once the work is accepted from A, we can work with Fred / Steve to propose a cache invalidation strategy. As of Varnish 3.0, we can introduce a specific HTTP request for this type of work to be implemented in VCL. Unlike Akamai, if we don鈥檛 provide this, there is no way for us to flush cache without manually intervening. Cache invalidation strategies here in the Varnish manual help: https://www.varnish-software.com/static/book/Cache_invalidation.html Examples of existing VCL鈥檚 live here: https://msstash.morningstar.com/projects/CORESVC/repos/varnish/browse.3.	Ensure both ID Service and Autocomplete endpoints properly respond with appropriate caching headers.C. Reference1.	Prior work in this same vein would include Autocomplete for Microsoft, which uses Akamai externally to cache. We can consider issues we鈥檝e seen with Akamai (invalidation, load spikes, etc) as input for the work we do setting up varnish.)Additionally, introducing varnish into the stack is an architectural change, so we鈥檒l need to notify the CAB of the change. We should have all of the above completed in staging first to show the result and have adequate information to defend the approach. We may still have to consider individual server capacity based on data set size or other functionality we may add, but varnish is a beast and if we can do our caching properly, we鈥檒l be able to save a lot of load on our stack.

From there, the note get sent automatically to that auto-generate group of users and they are able to see that impacted security in the context of the note. The current API we''re hooked up to does not work for models as holdings in accounts and we need to ensure that the M* id is being used for the custom SMAs (as it is to bring in performance data). The goal that if user A creates a note and tags it to Model B and user C has Model B within one of their accounts, User B would become part of that impacted accounts group so they would receive the note. or If User  A tags a note to a custom SMA (using M* mapped identifier) and User B holds that SMA in one of their accounts that User B would be part of the impacted accounts group.Please note: this is not contractually obligated work by 2/1 for ML but it does impact the experience for them since their account structure is unique.+Dependency: +In order to allow for this, we need the API team to confirm if there is an API that exists that includes the models as holdings and custom SMAs (using the M* identifier, so should be the same as any other security). For impacted accounts functionality, we depend on DataApiV2 endpoint /dataapi/v2/portfolios?holding={performanceId}. This endpoint can return accounts that contains a given holding.

The benefit will be that if in the future, if we are going to consolidate all those APIs (for the reason of simplicity, scalability, maintainability, or other technology reasons), the consumer of the Portfolio Service API would not be impacted.

In Direct Cloud today, it takes 8-10 seconds to display rolling returns of 15 funds in their base currencies. If I change the currency to USD, it takes another 6-8 seconds.

The categories of development: WORKFLOW TESTS, PAGE OBJECTS, SETUP, BUGFIX.For the most part, test cases will not dynamically create their data through UI automation. Databases will be created which contain data that triggers the TRX features we want to test. When the common workflow automations are executed, many test cases will automatically happen. E.g., for the rebalancing tests, there will be clients which are OOB/not OOB, OOB/not OOB in cash, have trade restrictions which prevent rebalance, etc. This approach will allow the creation of new test cases without adding automation code. Just adding new聽_data_聽will make new test cases happen. WORKFLOW TESTS depend on PAGE OBJECTS. Page objects will be created as necessary to support the workflow tests. There are existing page objects and workflow tests to use as templates. E.g., pages: clientPage, modelCompliancePage, tests: clientPageTest, rebalanceSingle. *Agile* Each WORKFLOW TEST will likely be a single story with multiple tasks. The tasks will usually be the workflow test and its required page objects.

This is mostly to verify that the data entered persists in the database and can be retrieved.

These shared libraries will reduce fully duplicated code between the product-specific services and both applications will benefit from changes and improvements to the shared, library.Assumptions & PrerequisitesMobile Service is based on the Play Framework and, as such, many aspects of the application leverage various parts of the framework. There may be opportunities to simplify/remove dependencies on Play in the libraries, though it isn''t an essential requirement. For example, we could leverage TypeSafe''s configuration library directly rather than indirect access through Play.Some amount of this work must be completed before the "split" can begin.Libraries will be based upon standalone, versioned projects which use dependency management, are built by and deployed through Jenkins, and are deployed to NEXUS.Libraries will adhere to semantic versioning.Pull request from both the teams will be reviewed by all.Separate repository for a shared library and both the team has access to it.High-Level TaskingFigure out what to do with RequestContextUse of the RequestContext class is prevalent across many layers of the application. If we can figure out a way to refactor away from it or provide a more appropriate abstraction depending on common use cases, then this class will not need to show up in other libraries. MOBSERV-534 - Introduce logging-specific abstraction to be used with ReqeustConext OPEN describes one, possible approach.RequestContext has a reference to the Customer object. We should determine whether or not this relationship is necessary and/or whether some different relationship may be created. For example, the module/library containing the RequestContext could export a CustomerInfo interface to which the Customer class would adhere.Caching packageEstablish a clearer APIClasses like service.caching.GemFireCacheManager do not belong in the library as it''s makeup is application-specific.Refactoring to certain extentDependency initialization (entry point to module)Config of caching propertiesWeb Service PackageEndpoint communication extraction, serialization and transformationWhat are the dependencies of specific packages?Async/Tasks/JobsAnalyze whether there is any benefit to putting these in a library. Superclasses might be a good option, but specific, concrete jobs may not as they depend on model objects which we likely will not want to include in shared libraries.Service/Repository ConsiderationsAnalyze whether there is any benefit to putting these in a library. Some common service/repository combinations may be worthwhile in cases such as Securities (Info/Detail/Quote) though model classes would also have to be moved to the libraries.Controllers And Filters (Actions)We have some controllers that are specific to products (such as Retail / Advisor ) and some controllers that are shared by all b', -1, 0, 5, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 0, 0, null, null, 'IIMOB-1198'),

Attached is some feedback that was received. Additionally, there are plans for them to share the prototype with prospective users and put together a business case for going to the Canadian market. Any usability testing or further requirements specific to accessibility are to be determined by some of the tickets contained within the GB-821 epic.*Information on this Epic''s Relation to Business Strategy:*As mentioned in the Advisor Workstation epic, GB-367, the users of Advisor Workstation are a good target market for Goal Bridge. Goal Bridge is intended to be an international tool and there are revenue targets that we can assist in hitting by expanding internationally. Canada is a nice test case for this because WFE already has a Canadian engine that is up to date. The proactivity of the commercial product management team has also validated up front that there is some interest in a tool like Goal Bridge.*Intended Outcome and Measurement:*The ultimate measure of success is if we are able to deploy to the Canadian market in 2020. Our initial target is by end of Q1 2020 (largely pending work placed higher in priority such as the US integration and how much we need to do in the realm of accessibility support, which will be uncovered by this epic).

As of now, the Add-In works in desktop Excel for PCs only and there聽are couple issues compromising user experience. One is that Mac users cannot access the Add-In. Even though the majority of Add-In users are corporate users with PCs, this does limit the possibility of Add-In usage on personal computers or on Mac for some users. Second is the inconvenience of upgrading. Since聽most users are from corporates, software upgrades need to be approved and conducted by their IT department, which is time consuming, resulting in clients being on outdated versions and are reluctant to upgrade. Due to security requirements, sometimes the software is incompatible after upgrades, and involvement of IT is required for testing, quickly causing fatigue for both our Support team as well as clients. By adding Add-In to Office Cloud, upgrading will be automatic and will no longer require IT sanction. Additionally, as Cloud has become a more prominent solution for businesses, Office 365 and Google Cloud has been incorporated by more and more companies. Making sure our Add-In solutions are available on Cloud is beneficial to long-term business growth and sustainability. Since Office 365 and Google Cloud are two entirely different ecosystems, and our Add-In is already available in Microsoft environment, we would work on Add-In Office 365 first.聽聽Product Structure * Global聽 ** Profile ** Refresh Options ** Templates ** Help * C&E MP ** Series聽 ** Curve ** Element ** Upload聽 * Direct聽 ** Investment ** Economic Data ** Key Indicators聽Project Process: # Global features聽 # C&E Add-In features # Direct Add-In features聽聽Challenges:聽 * Challenge 1: Requirement of excellent feature performance since upgrading is automatic * Solution 1: Enable version control that allow users to decide if they want to upgrade, or if they want to downgrade to previous version聽 * Challenge 2: Local <> Cloud compatibility.
